## A Truly Decentralized Consensus Protocol

#### This is the core implementation of a novel consensus protocol that accommodates true decentralization avoiding centralization of power.
---

The majority of the now widely used permissionless blockchains were designed to be decentralized, but as they gain popularity, the system tends to become more centralized, undermining a blockchain's fundamental value. True decentralization will be supported by the novel consensus mechanism, securing the fundamental value of a blockchain.
